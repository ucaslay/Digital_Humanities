#problem 3

## NOTE 1: you always have to tell a varchar how many characters it can have!
## NOTE 2: I switched around the table order so that columns are defined
##         before they are referenced.
## NOTE 3: Column names can't have spaces, and must have a datatype, so I
##         changed 'artist or Reviewer' as well as 'playbill or newspaper'.

people
*id integer
- name varchar(50)
- born? date
- artist_or_Reviewer varchar(8)

## NOTE 4: 'location' is not a datatype, so I changed it to varchar.
performance
*id integer
- performance_by => people.id
- style varchar(20)
- when? date
- where? varchar(50)

Review
*id integer
- reviewer => people.id
- playbill_or_newspaper varchar(10)
