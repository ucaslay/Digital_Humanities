# Schema for Problem 1

# Here is a table for people.
## NOTE 1: you always have to tell a varchar how many characters it can have!
## NOTE 2: I switched around the table order so that columns are defined
##         before they are referenced.
## NOTE 3: You didn't specify a data type for signature, so I guessed.
books
*id integer
- title varchar(100)
- author varchar(50)
- published? date
- signature varchar(20)

people
*id integer
- name varchar(50)
- borrowed_books_id? => books.id

Lending
*id integer
- borrowed? date
- borrowed_books_id => books.id
- borrower_id => people.id
