# Schema for Problem 2

## NOTE 1: you always have to tell a varchar how many characters it can have!
## NOTE 2: You have a circular reference: people -> project -> people. We
##         can't do this in MySQL; we have to use a joining table instead!

attendance
*id integer
- date_of_attendance date

homework
- score integer

project
*id integer
- names => people.id

people
*id integer
- name varchar(50)
- attendance => attendance.id
- homework => homework.score
- groups => project.id
