    <topleft c="red"> well done! <lb/> 8,5/10</topleft>    
    
    <paragraph>I can't bel<crossedred>ei</crossedred><red>ie</red>ve it. Carl has not written to <lb/> me or sent me a postcard once since he's <lb/> been away in Egypt. It would be easier <lb/> if our phone was working. It's been <lb/> broken for ages! Dad can't fix it at the <lb/> moment, and we can't afford to buy a new <lb/> one. I would write to him, but he didn't <lb/> tell me the address of the villa he was <lb/> staying in. If only I had a mobile, I could <lb/>phone his mobile number. Eureka!!! <lb/> I could use next door's phone, oh, actually, <lb/> Mr and Mrs Crooel won't let me use it (they're <lb/> my next door neighbours). I know. I'll use <lb/> the phone box!!! (I think I've got some <lb/>change).</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Goodness me, this phone box stinks. <lb/> EEAW, I don't even want to know <lb/> what that is. Anyway, I hope his phone is <lb/> switched on. What's it again??? Oh, yeah, <lb/> 1312632. Arrgh!! What's happening!!! <lb/> Who's shaking the phone box!! Who turned <lb/> <crossed>off out</crossed> <corrected> ok out</corrected> the lights!!!</paragraph>

    <paragraph>WOW!!! Where am I? Why is everything <lb/> so smokey? Everything is silver except the <lb/> air around me, it's black, and I'm <lb/> standing in a silver pod, with some-<lb/>thing that looks like a phone. When<lb/> you look up there are millions of metal <lb/> poles, and some of them have what look <lb/>like funny shaped cars whizzing along<lb/> attached to the metal poles at the top.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>There seem<crossed>e</crossed>s to be no-one around <added_later>the phone box</added_later>. <lb/>Yuk! Someone has just walked past. All their <lb/>skin is black and crusty and in the side of <lb/>their neck are gitt like things. The whites <lb/>of his or her eyes are grey and he, or she has <lb/>no hair. I also notice that he, or she has a <lb/>clear gas mask. It's from all the smoke.</paragraph>
    
    <left_red>"breeth" = noun <lb/> "to breathe" = verb</left_red>
    
    <paragraph>Goodness me! I just stepped <lb/>outside the phone box and I couldn't <lb/>breath<added_red>e</added_red>. It was like a king cobra was <lb/>wrapped around my neck and if I <lb/>was to get a little bit of air in it was <lb/>horrible, like when you stop at red man <lb/>beside the traffic lights and a bus <lb/>is stopped beside you and you're <lb/>getting breaths of carbon dioxide. <lb/>But this was 100x worse. Now I know <lb/>what all the black air is: all the <lb/>pollution. But that doesn't help me <lb/>figure out where I am.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>What's that? It's a big <lb/>poster, <added_later>on the wall</added_later>saying: Monday 26th May <lb/>1312632. I've gone into the future!!! <lb/>Wait, I recognise the date. It's Carl's <lb/>number! When I typed it in on the <lb/>key pad in the phone box, that must <lb/>have taken me into the future: I must <lb/>get back and warn everyone! <lb/>I'll type in 2008. Nothing was happening. <lb/>Then, Hello, dearie, an old woman answered. <lb/>Who is it? I hung up. Uh, oh. How do I <lb/>get back then?</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I've been thinking for ages about <lb/>what to do. There only seems to be one <lb/>good option, fix and stop all the pollution. <lb/>This sort of seems like a dream, but a fun <lb/>dream. I'll just have to find out where <lb/>the city's power source is.<crossed>But I've got to go <lb/> outside (again)</crossed></paragraph>

    <paragraph><crossed>It was a lot easier to find <lb/> that i thought it would be</crossed>I got round <lb/>the corner and there was a BIG sign <lb/>saying CITY'S POWER SOURCE. <lb/>It's very oily and extremely big. Ah, this will <lb/>be the switch.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Everything has gone dark <lb/>and I can't see where I'm going. <lb/>I keep on banging into long bars and <lb/>wires and knobs. Yess!! The door!!!</paragraph>

    <paragraph>There is uproar outside. <lb/>I sealed the door with stones on the <lb/>ground so no one could get in <lb/>to turn the switch back on.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I've been thinking. If I'm <lb/>going to suck out all the pollution <lb/>I'm going to need help. Which is not <lb/>going to be easy.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Everyone keeps on staring <lb/>at me. It's very annoying. I hope people <lb/>will help!</paragraph>

    <paragraph>OK. I think this will work. I've <lb/>put up posters everywhere. They say... <lb/>MEETING BESIDE PHONE BOX <lb/>BE THERE AT 2pm. I hope they read <lb/>English. And English time.</paragraph>
